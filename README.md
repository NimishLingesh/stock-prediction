## Code Check in Guidelines:

1. Create a new branch (eg: devansh/implementdashboard) when you start with new Issue/Work Item.
2. Work in that newly created branch
3. Test your changes well.
4. Raise a Pull Request against the main branch. Add rest of the team members as the reviewer.
5. Merge it with the main branch when you have an approval.

## Progress:

1. Explored on the data Specifications for each of the column.
2. Figured out the columns that have missing data.
3. For this data,  five columns - NewMarketSegment, TradeDate, Close, IssuedShares and MarketCapitalization have some missing values.
4. Count of null values is as follows:
      NewMarketSegment->  645
      TradeDate-> 296
      Close-> 296
      IssuedShares-> 296
      MarketCapitalization-> 296
5. Approaching the best way to fill in the missing values depending on the data.
